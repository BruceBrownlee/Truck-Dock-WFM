# Ted-Bakes-Cakes-Python
Predictive Model for Labor Hours Forecasting

## Purpose
Demonstrate machine learning methods for forecasting daily labor hours required for baking cakes in the Ted Bakes Cakes demonstration.

## Approach
Reads in Ted's logbook that records number of cakes baked by type for each of four types of cake.
Also records total labor hours required.

Python application reads in logbook from Excel into a Pandas dataframe.
A simple linear regression model is used to fit logbook data and tested against a split portion of the logbook data.
A confusion matrix and goodness of fit data is presented.
